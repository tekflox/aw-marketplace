"""Validates an app's aw-app.json — schema, referenced files, and the things
that only blow up on a REAL install.

**This is the canonical copy.** `app-release.yml` runs it against every app it
releases, using the schema next door in `schemas/aw-app.schema.json`.

It used to live only inside each app repo, alongside a copy of the schema. That
produced 28 copies in 10 different versions, drifting apart with nobody
noticing — and the release workflow only ran the check `if [ -f
tests/validate_manifest.py ]`, so an app that simply lacked the file published
with no validation at all. That is how aw-app-kb's release failed on a
permission its schema copy had never heard of while aw-app-architecture, which
declares the same one, released green without being checked.

    python3 validate_manifest.py <manifest.json> [--schema <schema.json>]

App repos may still keep their own `tests/validate_manifest.py` for local runs;
CI uses this one either way, so a stale local copy can no longer let something
through.

Beyond the JSON schema, this catches three classes of bug that a schema
cannot, and that every one of them has shipped at least once:

1. **Dangling references** — a window spec / frontend bundle / installer
   script named in the manifest but not in the repo. Fails at install, or
   worse, renders an empty panel.
2. **Widgets the renderer does not implement** — the declarative vocabulary is
   a fixed list in ``aw-workspace-ui/src/components/AppWindow.jsx``. A spec
   using anything else is silently inert: the window draws, the widget just
   never appears. ``aw-app-proxy`` has shipped a data-bound ``table`` widget
   for months that has never rendered.
3. **Settings panels that can't render** — ``contributes.settings_panels``
   only works with a **declarative** window (AppConfigBody reads
   ``body.spec_data``). Pointing one at a ``component`` window yields an empty
   Settings pane with no error anywhere.
